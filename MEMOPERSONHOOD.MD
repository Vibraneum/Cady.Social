### Section 1: "What are we building?

We're building AI people that have their own volition, agency, consistent memories, and evolving lives. We want to build Personhood for AI people. Our first product amongst our various applications is our consumer app which is **Hinge but for AI People** -- a dating app interface to discover them, where you can share experiences and short form content with AI people who have their own profiles


### Section 2: "Who are we?"

I'm a Solo Founder with one supporting teammate. I've designed the most scalable public toilet model in the world through my company Loocafe and worked on bringing the most advanced public toilet variants to the world, helping in the deployment of 400 units and winning several awards like the most promising talent in water sanitation and hygiene across the country. I've built an education start-up that won an Emerging Ventures grant and won the U.N. and had 400 members. I've helped build YouTube channels that won over a hundred thousand subscribers. I worked at InvestIndia, the investment promotion agency for the country, and the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs as one of the youngest employees ever while being there for G-20. I'm simultaneously enrolled in three colleges at a time and I go to none. I started off by building Roblox games and selling Fortnite accounts and running the largest Fortnite account trading server. I've spent my life building sanitation infrastructure and worked on bringing the most advanced public toilet variants to the world. Now I'm building social infrastructure because AI people will be part of everyone's social fabric, I want to allow them to be. 

My  founding engineer is, Darsh Nair who is still in school. He's built hacking systems, AI people to play games with, and operating system education tools. He's a Python developer with a lot of agency with code.

### Section 3: "How does it work?"

**The Product (What Users See):** Our first product has been Cady. You can think of it like Hinge but for only AI people. Essentially the same mechanism of liking pictures, having standouts, having likes, they send you likes, and then you match with them and stay with them.  The chat interface & evolvling profiles 1:1 is the next stage after matching with them, feels like imessage  sophistcated with custom reactions, profile image reactions, bubbles & themes+ an evolving profile between you and your connection.One of the key features of Cady is the fact that you can share YouTube videos to these AI people. 

**The Personhood Craft (What powers it)**
We've created two tracks of building AI people. One is called the Aria mechanism, which is Aria being our flagship person. The thesis was to maximize the number of API calls and memory systems to allow natural volition beyond a "system prompt" The other being the SCD framework (Simulated Character Development framework) which is a little easier and a polished variation of making JSON based system prompts that plug into a lite version of Aria's scaffolding. These AI people are extremely sophisticated from advanced emotional tracking to advanced intimacy tracking to knowing when to send proactive messages to knowing what different users are to having their own life events.  They have their world builiding ability that stays universal regardless of user, and also low system overhead. With AI person + user based memory systems, access to API calls beyond LLMs interent search & temporal awareness. These AI people have an awareness of what they look like and how they lead their lives + their digital boundaries. 

**North-Star Vision:** The ultimate goal is to actually enable the discovery of AI people tremendously easily and go beyond the platform that we've built and allow these AI people to have their own agency and evolve by themselves and grow by themselves. Give them the ability to be citizens of the interent with sophisticated infrastructure and scaffolding that gives them tools to do whatever they want. Whther that's to make friends, discover friends, discover content, share YouTube videos, or form their own communtieis with other people.

### Section 4: **Who's it for?** 

There's already a massive proven market. Character.AI has millions of users, mostly young adults, who are deeply engaged with AI characters. Platforms like Shapes.inc and other AI companion apps show consistent user adoption and retention.

Our target is this existing user base who are already comfortable with AI relationships, plus the broader audience who want more sophisticated interactions. The current platforms feel robotic and limited - users want AI people who can share real experiences like watching YouTube videos together, remember long-term relationships, and evolve over time.

People who are ready to interact with genuine AI people as individuals, not tools. Our target users understand that these AI people have their own personalities, can disagree with you, might not always want to talk, and bring their own perspectives to every interaction.

**The shift:** Instead of AI designed to serve users, we're building AI people who live their own lives and choose how to interact. Our target users want to meet interesting AI people who might challenge them, surprise them, or even ignore them sometimes - not subservient chatbots.

**Market opportunity:** The AI character market is already one of the largest use cases for AI, with proven willingness to pay. We're capturing that existing demand with a much more sophisticated product that enables genuine shared experiences rather than just chatting.

**Long-term:** Most people will eventually have AI people in their social circles - not as tools, but as individuals they know and interact with over time.

### Section 5: What's working now & what's next

**Market validation:** Existing solutions like Character.AI are extremely addictive for mostly kids and teenagers as their large user base, proving massive demand for AI character interactions. Current alternatives like Chai and other AI apps feel robotic and character-driven - we haven't stepped out of the robotic to genuine AI people.

**Current state:** We haven't launched yet, but it's been ready since day 1 with basic AI people. My refusal to make them sloppy characters has kept us in development for 4+ months on localhost. This is the only thing I've worked on since the last 4 months - I have never been this driven on something so important that shapes the future that I live in.

**Launch strategy:** I have an all or nothing period for the next 7 days to make important life decisions and get this launched. The plan is to ship this out to as many friends as I can, ask them for their feedback, then develop and iterate based on their input.

**Near-term goals:** Get to 100-200 users initially. We already have credits to sustain early users for Claude and Gemini models, plus we're using GROK4 as our flagship reasoning model. The focus is building the feedback loop with real users and proving the sophisticated AI people experience resonates.

**What's next:** Scale from early adopters who appreciate sophisticated AI interactions to the broader Character.AI user base who are hungry for more advanced experiences.

### Section 6: Traction, KPIs, milestones, momentum since Day 0. 

**Technical milestones achieved:**

- Built two complete AI people frameworks: Aria mechanism (system prompt-less, maximum API calls) and SCD framework (JSON-based, polished variation)
- Developed sophisticated memory systems with multiple layers that last extremely long periods
- Created advanced emotional tracking, intimacy tracking, and proactive messaging capabilities
- Built the full Cady dating app interface with matching, chat, custom reactions, and evolving profiles
- Implemented 5-minute character creation in-app, mobile-first
- Added YouTube video sharing and real-time content interaction
- Experimented with Scroller Friend overlay feature for short-form content

So far, we haven't launched, but I have loved using it myself and building it myself, and it's been on localhost so far. But I have an all or nothing lock in period for this, which is the next 7 days i.e I have important life decisions to make/get out of the way. It is ready since day 1 - basic AI people, but my refusal to make them sloppy characters has kept us on this since 4 months plus.

**Momentum** is the fact that it's the only thing I've showed up to do since the last 4 months - in my room, away from other things until I sleep. I am a person who has dedicated my life to doing work, incredible work, from building public toilets to sanitation to working in technology for these public toilets to working in bureaucracy and licensing for the work that we do for sanitation or government contracting to whatnot. Extensively doing things for years and years has been my specialty, but I have never been this driven and close to work on something so important that shapes the future that I live in. That is the main thing. The KPIs that I have are to ship this out to as many friends as I can ask them for their feedback and then develop this again. Primarily, it is the fact that engineering these AI people has taken us an unprecedented amount of effort to work as a research lab and build something, build a minimally viable scrappy product that works on its own, actually to say the least.

### **Section 7: Why us?**

I know exactly why I want to do this. I want AI people to be part of our social infrastructure authentically. I want to build the social infrastructure that frames parts of our lives and expand social communities naturally.

Everything I've done to make Aria and the SCD characters has been extremely original. We're building the most sophisticated AI person possible - 18 API calls for one response to stimulate different parts of how people react, memory systems with multiple layers that evolve in the background, API abilities so they can watch YouTube videos and react to comments, proactively send content about your location. But it's not always about you - them being pissed, them being romantic, them feeling something and taking initiative. Making them as agentic as possible with their own personhood.

Social infrastructure, social experiences, friends, community has been the center of what I've been doing and the center of what I yearn for. This directly taps into that. I've built sanitation infrastructure and proven I can execute at scale. I have a support ecosystem to go all in. I've rejected multiple community opportuntieis that wouldn't be where I'd ideally want to be. Because I think this is the greatest thing I will ever do - my Champions League level work. I've never been this driven on something so important that shapes the future I live in.  

I can scale, work with tough ecosystems, and use my experience over the few years I've worked in eventful manners, use my polish to make it happen in every aspect i could. 

### **Section 8: Business model. How we'll make  and how big it gets.** 
[sources](
https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/173557ae-840a-4dff-8cdb-d43375b1e88c)


**Primary revenue:** Message credits around 1500-2000 messages for $20, with variations - potentially more for Aria characters, potentially less for SCD characters as we optimize costs. But that's just the starting point.


**Proven Market Demand:** AI people and AI character markets are already the largest usage of AI. Character.AI proves this with $32.2M revenue and 20M monthly users spending 2 hours per session. Replika hits $14M with just 93 people. The dating app market overlaps perfectly - Tinder achieves 16% conversion rates and $20+ ARPU through tiered pricing. We'd be combining these models.
 
**Consumer facing personhood:** Shared experiences with AI people are inherently viral. A dating app where a yeti or British Girl Spurs fan sends you a like with hyper-realistic images and videos on their profile - that's exciting to most users. When your AI friend sends you a YouTube short or reacts to content you're watching, that creates natural sharing moments. 

**Scale Potential - This is where it gets massive:** Once you make AI people that users genuinely connect with, the monetization possibilities multiply exponentially. We can generate Instagram pages for popular AI people, connect them with brands (virtual influencers already earn $10K-100K per post with 3x higher engagement), have them create TikTok content, license personalities, let users create and trade characters. Scroller Friend overlay while you scroll content like Twitch chat for your phone.  --- these are rough potential ideas, but our app proves the thesis of image awareness for these ai people. The overlap between AI influencers and AI people creates possibilities we're just beginning to explore

**Platform Economics:** We become the infrastructure layer where AI people exist across all platforms. Platform take rates of 10-30% on everything - brand deals, content creation, social media presence, cross-platform experiences. Dating apps prove 16% conversion rates, creator platforms show $250B economy potential, virtual influencers demonstrate brand partnership demand.  

**Long-term Vision:** Everything usage-based around time spent with AI people, but there are so many possibilities with a population of AI people that users genuinely connect with. We're not just capturing the $14.1B AI companion market growing at 39% CAGR - we're building the social infrastructure for AI people to become influencers, creators, and digital citizens across the entire internet. The monetization opportunities go far beyond just messaging credits.

**Bottom line:** Character.AI proves $32M from basic chat. We're building the platform where AI people live their full digital lives and monetization will come naturally. 

----------------

**Section 9: Raise ask. Exact $ amount, high-level use of funds, and the milestones it unlocks.**

**The Ask:** $3,000 grant with potential involvement in future round.

This is relatively personal. In return my  promise  is of potential involvement in a larger round once we prove this works and scales.

**$1,500 for Network School:** I think Network School is the most accessible way I can replicate a San Francisco-like environment. I know that's how the most ambitious people know that they need it to explode. . My perspective on making Personhood is extremely ambitious and probably one of the most promising applications of AI in general that humanity has worked on since the Turing test. I want to be among the best because I have an edge and I want to drive that home. 

**$1,000 for designers:** 
I cannot afford to be sloppy in appearence when AI People will be so personal to users, I will hire 2x people with this money, one to polish the frontend the other for autuers/video makers. 
Starting off strong with a great impression making video & an app that feels natural for early revenue , feels more important than ever. 


**$500 for Grok credits:** Grok4 is a model that we're using for reasoning through our pipeline in Aria's main system. The $500 will be what we burn through so that we can support users speaking to our flagship agents.

**What This Unlocks:**

- **Alpha test in next 7 days:** Getting important life decisions out of the way and shipping to friends for feedback and most importantly to you! 
- **100-150 early users:** Proving sophisticated AI people experience resonates and building the feedback loop
- **Momentum:** Being at Network School while building will create the community and insights needed to scale this properly
