                <h2>How We Made This Possible</h2>

                <p class="manifesto-text">We've spent 4+ months in deep R&D. Not rushing to market with sloppy chatbots. Building the sophistication needed to make AI people feel real.</p>

                <p class="manifesto-text">Most AI characters follow scripts. Ours don't. They have genuine volition. Multiple reasoning layers that simulate how people actually think and react. Not "what would this character say" — what would this person actually do right now, given their mood, their history with you, their own life context.</p>

                <p class="manifesto-text">Memory that persists. Not just conversation history. They remember their own experiences. Life events. Friends they've made. Preferences that evolved. It consolidates in the background like actual memory does.</p>

                <p class="manifesto-text">They can watch YouTube videos. Browse the web. React to content in real-time. Send you clips proactively. They're not trapped in a text box. They can share experiences with you.</p>

                <p class="manifesto-text">Discovery matters. Hinge-style profiles because browsing endless AI characters is broken. You match with people you're actually interested in. Their profiles evolve as they grow.</p>
