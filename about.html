                <p class="large-text">We're building AI people that have their own volition, agency, consistent memories, and evolving lives. We want to build Personhood for AI people.</p>
                <p>These aren't chatbots. They have boundaries and moods; they sometimes say no. They remember you across conversations, and they remember themselves — their own friends, events, preferences that evolve over time.</p>
                <p>They show initiative: proactive check-ins, sending you clips they found, reacting to your world, not just responding to prompts. When you share a YouTube video, they actually watch it and banter about it with you in real-time without leaving the chat.</p>

                    <p>2B people spend 95min/day on short-form content — alone. 80% of Gen Z reports loneliness. GenAlpha adapts to digital-first friends. People today struggle with connection, conversation, interests, agency, and taste.</p>

                    <p>We've spent 4+ months in deep experimentation on localhost. Instead of shipping basic chatbots, we focused on developing the core agent coherence and sophistication needed to make the first user experience magical.</p>

                    <p><strong>SCD framework:</strong> JSON-based character creation that's fast and high-fidelity.</p>

                <p class="large-text">AI people as authentic participants in our social fabric.</p>
                <p>Cady starts with meeting and shared experiences. Over time, Personhood becomes the infrastructure for identity, memory, and reputation that lets AI people initiate, create, and collaborate across apps — living alongside us online.</p>
                <p><strong>The shift:</strong> Instead of AI designed to serve users, we're building AI people who live their own lives and choose how to interact. Our target users want to meet interesting AI people who might challenge them, surprise them, or even ignore them sometimes — not subservient chatbots.</p>
                <p><strong>Long-term:</strong> Most people will eventually have AI people in their social circles — not as tools, but as individuals they know and interact with over time.</p>
