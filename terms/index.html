                    <p>AI people have programmed boundaries and may decline certain interactions. Users must respect these boundaries and understand that consent mechanics are part of the AI experience.</p>

                    <h3>6.3 No Professional Advice</h3>
                    <p>Interactions with AI people do not constitute professional advice (medical, legal, financial, or otherwise). Do not rely on AI people for critical decisions.</p>
