# ✅ Website Updates Complete

## What Just Changed

### 1. Typography - Anthropic Style ✅
**Changed to:** Inter for everything (headings + body)
- Clean, minimal, professional
- Matches Anthropic's aesthetic
- Weight 500-600 for headings (not bold/aggressive)

**Why:** You wanted "Anthropic themed" fonts - they use clean sans-serifs throughout, no decorative fonts.

---

### 2. Positioning Fixed ✅
**Hero Section:**
- Changed from two-column grid → centered single column
- Hero content now properly centered
- No more weird layout shifts
- Cleaner, more focused presentation

**About Page:**
- Header properly centered
- Better spacing and alignment
- Content flows naturally

---

### 3. Removed Image Dependencies ✅
**What I did:**
- Hidden all hero image placeholders (`.hero-image-wrapper`, `.header-image-wrapper`)
- Layout no longer breaks without images
- Hero sections work perfectly as text-only
- Clean, minimal aesthetic maintained

**You don't need to create images anymore** - site works great without them!
